- What OS am I running, and why is it Ubuntu <i class="fa-brands fa-ubuntu"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>.

> ℹ️ **Note**

> If you don't have spare NUC (or any device capable of running MicroK8s) laying around, you can create a VM and play with things there.
> I really recommend using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for that.

> As mentioned above, all the commands will be run on `Ubuntu`, so you should get `Vagrant` image with that OS. You can find it here: [https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/kinetic64](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/kinetic64)
