# Kamhome project

In this project I will attempt to run my own Kubernetes cluster on a server sitting in my office.


## Goals

- Have a separate network (Homecloud) for running Kubernetes and other internal application like Home Assistant.
- Only selected devices on the main LAN should be able to access Homecloud.
- Have an internal DNS server for local applications.
- Expose some applications on my public IP.
